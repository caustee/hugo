My name is Costin È˜tefan and this is my blog.

I'm a Technical consultant with a broad knowledge of network architecture, virtualization, on-prem physical data centers. I've been a Technical Lead in many projects in the DevOps area. 

Passionate and curious individual with an affinity for exploring new technologies to drive innovative solutions and enhance efficiency.

I have experience with large deployments of complex solutions mostly using Ansible automated deployments.

Seasoned professional with a diverse background spanning networking, security, application delivery, virtualization, on-premises data centers, DevOps, demonstrating adaptability and expertise across multiple fields throughout a distinguished career.

My current focus is cutting-edge cloud-native technologies like eBPF on Kubernetes, and using DevOps practices to combine my 2 main technical worlds: Networking and Cloud Native.

This blog is fully automated, it is based on Hugo and hosted on Github Pages.
